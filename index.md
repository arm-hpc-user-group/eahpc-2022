## Paper Submissions (CLOSED)

Submissions via EasyChair [EAHPC-2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eahpc2022).

As part of the [IEEE Cluster 2022](https://clustercomp.org/2022/) conference we will host a 1/2 day Arm workshop on evaluating emerging, server-class, Arm technology.

### Abstract
This workshop focuses on the porting and optimization of scientific and high-performance workloads to the Arm architecture. The last few years have seen an explosion of 64-bit Arm based processors targeted towards server and infrastructure workloads – often with a specialization towards a specific domain – such as HPC, cloud and machine learning.

New designs based on the Arm v9 architecture including the Neoverse core design have become the foundation for a number of new processor designs including Amazon’s 64-core Graviton 3, SiPearl’s Rhea chip, and NVIDIA’s Grace supercomputing-focused CPU. At the same time, Data Processing Units (DPUs) and “converged accelerators” with Arm cores and GPUs or other accelerators expanded the potential applications of Arm HPC to the networking and graphics card acceleration spaces.
In this workshop we invite papers on the porting and, if available, optimization of high-performance workloads for this new generation of Arm-based processors. We welcome performance optimization studies either through access to real hardware or via simulation/emulation frameworks, for current- and future-generation Arm hardware. 

We are also interested in the evaluation of the usage of Arm platforms for workloads from the data-intensive, HPC, edge computing,  and AI arenas. Of specific interest is work that targets cross-over/emerging application areas such as machine learning, deep learning, bioinformatics, and analytics.

This workshop is the third iteration of EAHPC and is a proceedings-based workshop that is closely related to the series of workshops organized at ISC, SC and the Arm Research Summit by groups like the [Arm HPC User Group (AHUG)](a-hug.org).
